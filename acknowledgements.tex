The subject of this thesis is a subject that I have been passionate about for many years and from the beginning of my university studies. For this reason
I would like to thank my supervisors, Evangelos Dermatas and Anthony Tzes, for their guidance and for giving me the opportunity to dive deep into this fascinating subject. I would also like to thank Nikolaos Evangeliou (PostDoctoral Associate at NYU Abu Dhabi) for giving me feedback on this thesis. Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends and family for their huge support and for pushing me during the pandemic to conquer my academic goals.
