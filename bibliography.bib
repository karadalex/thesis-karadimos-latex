  abstract={Grasping of an object by robot hand is always challenging due to the uncertainties such as robot non-linearities, unstructured objects with unknown location and stiffness, unknown contact types. To address these challenges, the fundamental task is to achieve the mathematical model of the robot hand, collect information about the object and model the contact between the hand and the object. In this paper, mathematical model of a three fingered Barrett Hand is developed using the Lagrangian method. Joint and cartesian space motions are simulated on the basis of computed torque algorithm. A contact model is then developed for hand-object coupled system assuming that the object properties are well known. Contact model is also simulated under different environment stiffness. Simulation studies verify the joint and cartesian space motions along with the estimated contact force. Implementation of the control for optimizing the contact force will be presented soon.},

  abstract={This paper presents an optimized, robust inverse kinematics solution in a closed form for redundant manipulators with seven degrees of freedom and zero link offsets like the KUKA LBR iiwa lightweight robot. The computation allows for full range elbow self-motion manifold control, defined by an intuitive angle parameter. Furthermore, by using common configuration parameters, all possible solutions for a single effector pose are taken into account and full arm configuration control is realized. The algorithm was evaluated looking at configuration reliability and continuity for an exemplary, challenging path. The results show that commanded arm configurations are not changing spontaneously inside a trajectory. Even for varying elbow self-motion manifold angles, the joint trajectories stay continuous and the presented algorithm provides consistent solutions. In a second evaluation, the algorithm was implemented in three programming languages and analyzed with respect to computing times. The tests demonstrate short runtimes and overall real-time capability.},

  abstract = "This paper presents a novel analytic method to uniquely solve inverse kinematics of 7 degrees-of-freedom manipulators while avoiding joint limits and singularities. Two auxiliary parameters are introduced to deal with the self-motion manifolds: the global configuration (GC), which specifies the branch of inverse kinematics solutions; and the arm angle (ψ) that parametrizes the elbow redundancy within the specified branch. The relations between the joint angles and the arm angle are derived, in order to map the joint limits and singularities to arm angle values. Then, intervals of feasible arm angles for the specified target pose and global configuration are determined, taking joint limits and singularities into account. A simple metric is proposed to compute the elbow position according to the feasible intervals. When the arm angle is determined, the joint angles can be uniquely calculated from the position-based inverse kinematics algorithm. The presented method does not exhibit the disadvantages inherent to the use of the Jacobian matrix and can be implemented in real-time control systems. This novel algorithm is the first position-based inverse kinematics algorithm to solve both global and local manifolds, using a redundancy resolution strategy to avoid singularities and joint limits."

  abstract={We devised an interactive environment in which subjects could perform simulated laparoscopic maneuvers, using either unconstrained movements or standard mechanical contact typical of a box-trainer. During training the virtual tool responded to the absolute position in space (Position-Based) or the orientation (Orientation-Based) of a hand-held sensor. Volunteers were further assigned to different sequences of target distances (Near-Far-Near or Far-Near-Far). Orientation-Based control produced much lower error and task times during training, which suggests that the motor system more easily accommodates tool use with degrees of freedom that match joint angles. When evaluated in constrained (physical box-trainer) conditions, each group exhibited improved performance from training. However, Position-Based training enabled greater reductions in movement error relative to Orientation-Based (mean -13.7\%, CI:-27.1, -0.4). Furthermore, the Near-Far-Near schedule allowed a greater decrease in task time relative to the Far-Near-Far sequence (mean -13.5\%, CI:-19.5, -7.5). Training at shallow insertion in virtual laparoscopy might promote more efficient movement strategies by emphasizing the curvature of tool motion. In addition, our findings suggest that an understanding of absolute tool position is critical to coping with mechanical interactions between the tool and trochar.},

  abstract={Robotic surgery has experienced a rapid progress in a diversity of interventions, especially in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In this type of interventions the patient body is accessed by inserting especial instruments through small incisions. As these instruments are manipulated by robotic assistants, passive wrists are incorporated for free compliance with the port of entry. With this wrist configuration it is only possible to locate accurately an instrument tip if its port of entry or fulcrum point is known. A vision oriented method is proposed in this paper to estimate the position of this external point of incision. It is based on motion analysis in a sequence of images where geometric properties of projected features and 3D transformations of the instrument are related. In this work we show that it is possible to accurately estimate the position and orientation of this 3D point, as well as the orientation of the instrument with respect to the laparoscopic camera applying determined movements through the robotic assistant.},

Therefore, this article studies these efforts, which have been measured by a force sensor located between the wrist and the endoscope, and how to remove gravity and friction actions in order to obtain the abdominal efforts. The measure of these efforts indicates if the movements are done accordingly to the fulcrum point. To achieve this goal, a new control strategy, based on the emulation of passive wrists behavior, is proposed. Such methodology allows the assistant to minimize efforts over the patient.

  year={2017},  volume={},  number={},  pages={4233-4239},  
  abstract={Traditional robotic surgical systems rely entirely on robotic arms to triangulate articulated instruments inside the human anatomy. This configuration can be ill-suited for working in tight spaces or during single access approaches, where little to no triangulation between the instrument shafts is possible. The control of these instruments is further obstructed by ergonomic issues: The presence of motion scaling imposes the use of clutching mechanics to avoid the workspace limitations of master devices, and forces the user to choose between slow, precise movements, or fast, less accurate ones. This paper presents a bi-manual system using novel self-triangulating 6-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) tools through a flexible elbow, which are mounted on robotic arms. The control scheme for the resulting 9-DoF system is detailed, with particular emphasis placed on retaining maximum dexterity close to joint limits. Furthermore, this paper introduces the concept of gaze-assisted adaptive motion scaling. By combining eye tracking with hand motion and instrument information, the system is capable of inferring the user's destination and modifying the motion scaling accordingly. This safe, novel approach allows the user to quickly reach distant locations while retaining full precision for delicate manoeuvres. The performance and usability of this adaptive motion scaling is evaluated in a user study, showing a clear improvement in task completion speed and in the reduction of the need for clutching.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a gaze contingent controlled robotic arm for laparoscopic surgery, based on gaze gestures. The method offers a natural and seamless communication channel between the surgeon and the robotic laparoscope. It offers several advantages in terms of reducing on-screen clutter and efficiently conveying visual intention. The proposed hands-free system enables the surgeon to be part of the robot control feedback loop, allowing user-friendly camera panning and zooming. The proposed platform avoids the limitations of using dwell-time camera control in previous gaze contingent camera control methods. The system represents a true hands-free setup without the need of obtrusive sensors mounted on the surgeon or the use of a foot pedal. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used for real-time gaze gesture recognition. This method was evaluated with a cohort of 11 subjects by using the proposed system to complete a modified upper gastrointestinal staging laparoscopy and biopsy task on a phantom box trainer, with results demonstrating the potential clinical value of the proposed system.},

  year={2015},  volume={},  number={},  pages={204-210},  
  abstract={In minimal invasive robotic surgery (MIRS) port placement has a particular status accounted for joint limits of the robots. The port depicts a pivot point so that the robots movement is constraint by reducing its degrees of freedom (DOF). Additionally the workspace of reachable points is limited by the instrument length and the robots' flexibility. Our approach for optimizing the port position and evaluate the robots' performance uses a knowledge base, represented by trajectories, to generate a master trajectory of a specific operation type. Therefor a cluster algorithm is applied to establish a Markov model. To handle loops a second order Markov model is created as well. With the help of the each trajectory a transition matrix is build. By combining the most likely transitions of the clusters the chain is generated, giving a rough approximation of a master trajectory. A spatial probability distribution can be calculated for each point by discretization. Therefor, only the relevant clusters, respectively their points, are taken in account. This reflects the probability of a predicted direction by a specific point, which allows a more precise preparation of a master trajectory. After a workspace analysis of the robot it is possible to combine the knowledge of the robot's workspace and the trajectory of interest. By means of selected evaluation factors the robot's performance with a given pivot point is analyzed.},

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of manipulation, azimuth, and elevation angles of instruments on endoscopic intracorporeal knotting. The standard task was tying a surgeon's knot. Manipulation angles of 30{\textdegree}, 45{\textdegree}, 60{\textdegree}, 75{\textdegree}, and 90{\textdegree} with equal and unequal azimuth angles and elevation angles of 0{\textdegree}, 30{\textdegree}, and 60{\textdegree} were investigated. The endpoints were the execution time and parameters of knot analysis. The execution time was shorter with 60{\textdegree} than with either 90{\textdegree} or 30{\textdegree} manipulation angles (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01). Equal azimuth angles resulted in a shorter execution time than wide unequal angles (p < 0.001). A combination of 60{\textdegree} manipulation angle with 60{\textdegree} elevation angle had the shortest execution time (p < 0.001) and highest performance quality score (p < 0.02). A range of 45{\textdegree}--75{\textdegree} manipulation angles with equal azimuth angles is recommended. As the manipulation angle increases, the elevation angle has to increase accordingly.},

  abstract={We investigated the relationship between workspace reduction due to collisions and the distance between the endoscope and target organ to develop a new algorithm for endoscope navigation in pediatric endoscopic surgery. Proper endoscope position is important for pediatric endoscopic surgery: the endoscope needs to get close to the target organ to obtain a suitable field of view. However, collisions between the endoscope and instrument are more likely to happen when the endoscope get close to the target. This reduces the workspace and complicates pediatric endoscopic surgery. We developed a simplified model of the endoscope and instrument to simulate the influence of the distance between the endoscope and target on the workspace reduction due to collisions. The simulation results showed how the workspace reduction was affected. Based on the results, we will perform further experiments to determine the appropriate endoscope position.},

  abstract="Path planning and trajectory planning are crucial issues in the field of Robotics and, more generally, in the field of Automation. Indeed, the trend for robots and automatic machines is to operate at increasingly high speed, in order to achieve shorter production times. The high operating speed may hinder the accuracy and repeatability of the robot motion, since extreme performances are required from the actuators and the control system. Therefore, particular care should be put in generating a trajectory that could be executed at high speed, but at the same time harmless for the robot, in terms of avoiding excessive accelerations of the actuators and vibrations of the mechanical structure. Such a trajectory is defined as smooth. For such reasons, path planning and trajectory planning algorithms assume an increasing significance in robotics. Path planning algorithms generate a geometric path, from an initial to a final point, passing through pre-defined via-points, either in the joint space or in the operating space of the robot, while trajectory planning algorithms take a given geometric path and endow it with the time information. Trajectory planning algorithms are crucial in Robotics, because defining the times of passage at the via-points influences not only the kinematic properties of the motion, but also the dynamic ones. Namely, the inertial forces (and torques), to which the robot is subjected, depend on the accelerations along the trajectory, while the vibrations of its mechanical structure are basically determined by the values of the jerk (i.e. the derivative of the acceleration). Path planning algorithms are usually divided according to the methodologies used to generate the geometric path, namely:roadmap techniquescell decomposition algorithmsartificial potential methods.",

  abstract={   The determination of an optimal pivot point ({\$}{\$}{\{} OPP{\}}{\$}{\$}OPP) is important for instrument manipulation in minimally invasive surgery. Such knowledge is of particular importance for robotic-assisted surgery where robots need to rotate precisely around a specific point in space in order to minimize trauma to the body wall while maintaining position control. Remote center of motion (RCM) mechanisms are commonly used, where the RCM point is manually and visually aligned. If not positioned appropriately, this misalignment might lead to intolerably high forces on the body wall with increased risk of postoperative complications or instrument damage. An automated method to align the RCM with the {\$}{\$}{\{} OPP{\}}{\$}{\$}OPPwas developed and tested.},

  abstract="This chapter presents the very first application of the cutaneous-only sensory subtraction approach in teleoperation. It considers a simulated needle insertion in soft tissue along one direction. Part of the needle workspace is protected by a forbidden-region stiff active constraint, which is a common scenario for biopsies, deep brain stimulation and functional neurosurgery. Subjects are required to insert the needle inside the simulated soft tissue and stop the motion of the tool as soon as the presence of the stiff constraint is felt. The motion of the needle is controlled through an Omega 3 haptic interface. Accordingly to the sensory subtraction approach, the haptic feedback provided by the Omega 3 is substituted with cutaneous feedback provided by a pair of ungrounded fingertip cutaneous devices. Experiments show that the proposed cutaneous-only feedback approach, other than being intrinsically stable, improves teleoperation performance with respect to other sensory substitution techniques, such as the one using visual feedback in substitution of haptic feedback.",

  abstract={A simple and efficient randomized algorithm is presented for solving single-query path planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The method works by incrementally building two rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through, the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace. Some basic theoretical analysis is also presented.},
