abstract={Grasping of an object by robot hand is always challenging due to the uncertainties such as robot non-linearities, unstructured objects with unknown location and stiffness, unknown contact types. To address these challenges, the fundamental task is to achieve the mathematical model of the robot hand, collect information about the object and model the contact between the hand and the object. In this paper, mathematical model of a three fingered Barrett Hand is developed using the Lagrangian method. Joint and cartesian space motions are simulated on the basis of computed torque algorithm. A contact model is then developed for hand-object coupled system assuming that the object properties are well known. Contact model is also simulated under different environment stiffness. Simulation studies verify the joint and cartesian space motions along with the estimated contact force. Implementation of the control for optimizing the contact force will be presented soon.},

title={Robust inverse kinematics by configuration control for redundant manipulators with seven DoF},

pages={49-55},
abstract={This paper presents an optimized, robust inverse kinematics solution in a closed form for redundant manipulators with seven degrees of freedom and zero link offsets like the KUKA LBR iiwa lightweight robot. The computation allows for full range elbow self-motion manifold control, defined by an intuitive angle parameter. Furthermore, by using common configuration parameters, all possible solutions for a single effector pose are taken into account and full arm configuration control is realized. The algorithm was evaluated looking at configuration reliability and continuity for an exemplary, challenging path. The results show that commanded arm configurations are not changing spontaneously inside a trajectory. Even for varying elbow self-motion manifold angles, the joint trajectories stay continuous and the presented algorithm provides consistent solutions. In a second evaluation, the algorithm was implemented in three programming languages and analyzed with respect to computing times. The tests demonstrate short runtimes and overall real-time capability.},

abstract = "This paper presents a novel analytic method to uniquely solve inverse kinematics of 7 degrees-of-freedom manipulators while avoiding joint limits and singularities. Two auxiliary parameters are introduced to deal with the self-motion manifolds: the global configuration (GC), which specifies the branch of inverse kinematics solutions; and the arm angle (ψ) that parametrizes the elbow redundancy within the specified branch. The relations between the joint angles and the arm angle are derived, in order to map the joint limits and singularities to arm angle values. Then, intervals of feasible arm angles for the specified target pose and global configuration are determined, taking joint limits and singularities into account. A simple metric is proposed to compute the elbow position according to the feasible intervals. When the arm angle is determined, the joint angles can be uniquely calculated from the position-based inverse kinematics algorithm. The presented method does not exhibit the disadvantages inherent to the use of the Jacobian matrix and can be implemented in real-time control systems. This novel algorithm is the first position-based inverse kinematics algorithm to solve both global and local manifolds, using a redundancy resolution strategy to avoid singularities and joint limits."

abstract={We devised an interactive environment in which subjects could perform simulated laparoscopic maneuvers, using either unconstrained movements or standard mechanical contact typical of a box-trainer. During training the virtual tool responded to the absolute position in space (Position-Based) or the orientation (Orientation-Based) of a hand-held sensor. Volunteers were further assigned to different sequences of target distances (Near-Far-Near or Far-Near-Far). Orientation-Based control produced much lower error and task times during training, which suggests that the motor system more easily accommodates tool use with degrees of freedom that match joint angles. When evaluated in constrained (physical box-trainer) conditions, each group exhibited improved performance from training. However, Position-Based training enabled greater reductions in movement error relative to Orientation-Based (mean -13.7\%, CI:-27.1, -0.4). Furthermore, the Near-Far-Near schedule allowed a greater decrease in task time relative to the Far-Near-Far sequence (mean -13.5\%, CI:-19.5, -7.5). Training at shallow insertion in virtual laparoscopy might promote more efficient movement strategies by emphasizing the curvature of tool motion. In addition, our findings suggest that an understanding of absolute tool position is critical to coping with mechanical interactions between the tool and trochar.},

Details of the mechanical design, kinematic analysis and control mechanism of the robot are presented. The robot records motion of surgical tool manipulated by master surgeon, and provides physical guidance to the trainee based on the recorded motion.  The robotic manipulator can accurately reproduce the five degree of freedom manipulation of laparoscopic instrument during surgery. A hybrid spherical mechanism is applied for decoupling and reproducing the motion of surgical tool to facilitate implementation of control mechanism. The manipulators for left and right hands are capable of precise execution of a recorded trajectory with observed maximum error of 2.12 mm and 2 mm respectively during an experiment on user interaction.",
